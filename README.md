#### Introduction
Today there are many ways WPF localization projects mainly based on bindings.
This approach has its advandages and disadvandages. I do not like this approach because a huge number of bindings in xaml markup, additional delay when the page loads. Just more time to search for a string in the source code, that is when I see the text in the running program, first I need to find this line in the resx resources, and after only xaml containing this key.
Elas will help to you look to localization proccess from another side.
